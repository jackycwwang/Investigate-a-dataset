# Investigate-a-dataset
Performed an investigation on a chosen dataset, posed self-chosen questions, and shared the findings in Jupyter Notebook

Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project 2

In this project, we are going to apply what we have learned so far about data assessing, data cleaning, and data exploration process onto a self-chosen dataset. This is an open-ended project that we need to pose our own questions and look for answers to the questions. At the end, an analysis report is created to communicate the result.
